## Long-distance relationships
Long-distance relationships - social connections spanning space - have been a central building block of human sociality since at least the origin of _Homo sapiens_. Importantly, long-distance relationships may or may not cross group boundaries - they are not the same as intergroup relationships and may have served different functions over our evolutionary history ([Pisor & Ross 2022](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12110-022-09431-1)). However, whether talking about long-distance or intergroup relationships in humans, these relationships are flexible: humans are not always hostile towards people from other places, nor are we always friendly towards them ([Pisor & Ross 2023](https://osf.io/tc7xa/)).

### Tanzania Sociality and Fisheries Project (TSFP)
The [TSFP](https://labs.wsu.edu/tsfp/), directed by postdoc Dr Kris Smith and co-directed by HSL PI Dr Anne Pisor and frequent collaborator [Dr Monique Borgerhoff Mulder](https://anthropology.ucdavis.edu/people/fzborger) is a long-term research project studying the intersection of social relationships and natural resources along the Indian Ocean in the Tanga region of Tanzania. Drawing on theories and methods from diverse disciplines, including evolutionary anthropology, social psychology, and development economics, our goal is to better understand the connection between people’s relationships and their use of their natural resources, and in doing so, support communities in their efforts to improve their lives and protect their environment. We work closely with local NGOs in the area, such as [Mwambao Coastal Community Network](https://mwambao.or.tz/) and [Blue Ventures](https://blueventures.org/), and community members to develop research questions that will support and benefit the communities.

## Climate change adaptation

### ClimTo
[ClimTo](https://climto.org) is a smartphone app that crowdsources climate responses, enabling individuals to generate candidate climate responses, try others’ responses, and share what works with other people. By emphasizing goal setting and leveraging gamification, ClimTo encourages daily use, supporting preparation for climate impacts before they happen.

ClimTo is a startup founded by PI Anne Pisor in collaboration with [Washington State University](https://www.wsu.edu/), industry partner [Sonoma Technology](https://www.sonomatech.com/), and nonprofit-partner [Urbanova](https://www.urbanova.org/).

## Cooperative relationships with non-kin

### Chosen kin and cooperative childrearing
Humans engage in cooperative childrearing -- individuals other than parents often are important to raising children -- and in humans, even non-kin are sometimes involved. What are the benefits to chosen kin of investing in children who are not their own? How do children benefit? This is the subject of PhD student Ollie Shannon's ongoing PhD research, which focuses on cooperative childrearing among chosen family in Queer and poly communities in the Western US.
