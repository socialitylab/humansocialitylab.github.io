## Long-distance relationships

> Long-distance relationships - social connections spanning space - have been a central building block of human sociality since at least the origin of _Homo sapiens_. Evidence suggests that long-distance relationships have allowed us to manage shortfalls that strike our entire community -- including all of our everyday cooperative partners -- and to access resources never locally available. Importantly, long-distance relationships may or may not cross group boundaries --- they are not the same as intergroup relationships and may have served different functions over our evolutionary history. However, whether talking about long-distance or intergroup relationships in humans, these relationships are flexible: humans are not always hostile towards people from other places, nor are we always friendly towards them. We can study why flexible interest in long-distance relationships evolved in the human lineage through comparative research with non-human primates and by exploring data from human societies past and present. We can then make predictions about the cues that affect whether we are interested in long-distance relationships, and with whom, and better investigate the role of long-distance relationships in human social networks today.

#### Tanzania Sociality and Fisheries Project (TSFP)
> The [TSFP](https://labs.wsu.edu/tsfp/), directed by postdoc Dr Kris Smith and co-directed by HSL PI Dr Anne Pisor and frequent collaborator [Dr Monique Borgerhoff Mulder](https://anthropology.ucdavis.edu/people/fzborger) is a long-term research project studying the intersection of social relationships and natural resources along the Indian Ocean in the Tanga region of Tanzania. Drawing on theories and methods from diverse disciplines, including evolutionary anthropology, social psychology, and development economics, our goal is to better understand the connection between people’s relationships and their use of their natural resources, and in doing so, support communities in their efforts to improve their lives and protect their environment. We work closely with local NGOs in the area, such as Mwambao Coastal Community Network and Blue Ventures, and community members to develop research questions that will support and benefit the communities.

## ClimTo
[ClimTo](https://climto.org) is a smartphone app that crowdsources climate responses, enabling individuals to generate candidate climate responses, try others’ responses, and share what works with other people. By emphasizing goal setting and leveraging gamification, ClimTo encourages daily use, supporting preparation for climate impacts before they happen.

ClimTo is a startup founded by PI Anne Pisor in collaboration with WSU, industry partner Sonoma Technology, and nonprofit-partner Urbanova.
