# Long-distance relationships
Long-distance relationships - social connections spanning space - have been a central building block of human sociality since at least the origin of _Homo sapiens_. Importantly, long-distance relationships may or may not cross group boundaries - they are not the same as intergroup relationships and may have served different functions over our evolutionary history ([Pisor & Ross 2022](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12110-022-09431-1)). However, whether talking about long-distance or intergroup relationships in humans, these relationships are flexible: humans are not always hostile towards people from other places, nor are we always friendly towards them ([Pisor & Ross 2023](https://osf.io/tc7xa/)).

## Tanga Sociality and Fisheries Project
The [TSFP](https://labs.wsu.edu/tsfp/), directed by postdoc Dr Kris Smith and co-directed by HSL PI Dr Anne Pisor and frequent collaborator [Dr Monique Borgerhoff Mulder](https://anthropology.ucdavis.edu/people/fzborger), is a long-term research project studying the intersection of social relationships and natural resources along the Indian Ocean in Tanzania. Drawing on theories and methods from diverse disciplines, including evolutionary anthropology, social psychology, and development economics, our goal is to better understand the connection between peopleâ€™s relationships and their use of their natural resources, and in doing so, support communities in their efforts to improve their lives and protect their environment. We work closely with local NGOs in the area, such as [Mwambao Coastal Community Network](https://mwambao.or.tz/) and [Blue Ventures](https://blueventures.org/), and community members to develop research questions that will support and benefit communities.

# Climate change adaptation
How humans respond to climate change is inherently a cultural process, affected by innovation, modification, retention, and transmission ([Pisor et al. 2023](https://osf.io/at4wr/)). Even the way we construct infrastructure is a product of innovations and modifications we've kept and trained others in over time. At the HSL, we work to understand how climate change adaptation unfolds, what works where, and how we can best support communities as they respond ([Pisor et al. 2022](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17ybZHzYKK9SyaUuObjfVC5VbWQr9GA0n/)).

## Characterizing climate variability
Understanding what adaptations work under what conditions requires understanding the nitty gritty of "conditions" a bit better. With collaborators in the earth sciences, PI Anne Pisor is making predictions about what features of climate variability predict the kinds of climate adaptations people use successfully, [then modeling these predictions with empirical data](https://osf.io/r382h/).

# Cooperative relationships with non-kin
They say it takes a village to raise a child, and they're not wrong: humans have long cooperated with unrelated friends, neighbors, and business partners to benefit themselves and their families ([Hubbard et al. 2023](https://osf.io/6wap9/)). Thinking hard about and studying relationships with non-kin is a central theme at the HSL.

## Chosen kin and cooperative childrearing
Humans engage in cooperative childrearing -- individuals other than parents often are important to raising children -- and in humans, even non-kin are sometimes involved. What are the benefits to chosen kin of investing in children who are not their own? How do children benefit? This is the subject of PhD student Ollie Shannon's ongoing PhD research, which focuses on cooperative childrearing among chosen family in Queer and poly communities in the Western US.
