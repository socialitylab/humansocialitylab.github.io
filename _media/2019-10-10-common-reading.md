Rewinding from 2019 to two million years ago, [in this talk for WSU's Common Reading Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvbD8xcA6g), Dr. Anne Pisor walks through the forces of natural selection that favored so much flexibility in human inter-group behavior. She then illustrates how we can see the flexibility in our inter-group behavior in 2019, focusing on how globalization, technology, and migration are changing between-community relationships in South America.
