In [a blog post](https://www.hbes.com/human-intergroup-relations-are-profoundly-flexible/) riffing off of [her article with Cody Ross in Evolution & Human Behavior](https://osf.io/tc7xa/), Anne writes that intergroup relationships are profoundly flexible in humans, ranging from highly aggressive to highly tolerant. That said, our experiences shape which end of the distribution we expect, and scientists haven't been doing a great job at documenting variation in intergroup behavior partially because scientists *own* expectations influence what scientists study. Anne outlines ways forward, including diversifying the sciences and improving methodological design.
