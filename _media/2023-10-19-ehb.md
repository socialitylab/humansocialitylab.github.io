In [his blogpost](https://www.hbes.com/long-distance-friends-are-good/) summarizing [our article in Evolution & Human Behavior](https://www.socialitylab.org/2022/11/01/close-long.html), Kris provides a background on long-distance friendships in humans - from past examples to a priori predictions about how they should work - and then summarizes our findings from Tanzania. Take-home message: "People lean on their friends to get through hard times and long-distance friends can provide some kinds of help that close-distance friends might not be able to provide, no strings attached."
