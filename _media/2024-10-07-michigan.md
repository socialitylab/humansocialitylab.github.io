Anne represented biological anthropology as a speaker and panelist for Michigan Anthropology's annual Four-Field Symposium, focused on sustainability in 2024. The resulting conversation focused on locally led adaptation, community engagement, and who gets to decide what counts as sustainable. [The talks and panel discussion, including lots of insights for students, is available here](https://www.youtube.com/live/uP2v8s-AQ3o).
