Support from SESYNC enabled Anne and collaborator [James Holland Jones](https://heeh.stanford.edu/) to convene experts on climate adaptation and climate-adaptation-adjacent research from across disciplines. Products included [our 2022 _Nature Climate Change_ paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17ybZHzYKK9SyaUuObjfVC5VbWQr9GA0n/) and our 2023 special issue in Philosophical Transactions in the Royal Society, as well as spinoff collaborations involving workshop participants.

[Our successful application for the SESYNC workshop is here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dwdtiqeVPcTrwxipFaMtmcFJd8UcYPxa/).
