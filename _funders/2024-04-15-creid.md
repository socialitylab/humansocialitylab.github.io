This grant was awarded to joint PIs [Kris Smith](https://www.kristophermsmith.com/) (lab co-director) and [John Gachochi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0gcVLdAAAAAJ), in collaboration with [CREID East and Central Africa](https://creid-network.org/research-centers/creid-eca). The CREID Pilot Grant is meant for first-time PIs and includes built-in mentorship, with Anne and frequent lab collaborator [M. Kariuki Njenga](https://vetmed.wsu.edu/profile/njenga-m-kariuki/) as mentors. Climate change impacts infectious disease dynamics with implications for acute and chronic disease. This project is designed to identify existing cultural adaptations to Rift Valley Fever in two areas of Kenya, and to cross-pollinate these ideas between areas in an effort to share what works.
